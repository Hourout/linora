    the Python Imaging Library provides different resampling filters.
    
    NEAREST: Pick one nearest pixel from the input image. Ignore all other input pixels.
    BOX: Each pixel of source image contributes to one pixel of the destination 
         image with identical weights. 
    BILINEAR: For resize calculate the output pixel value using linear interpolation on all 
              pixels that may contribute to the output value. 
              For other transformations linear interpolation over a 2x2 environment 
              in the input image is used.
    HAMMING: Produces a sharper image than BILINEAR, 
             doesnâ€™t have dislocations on local level like with BOX.
    BICUBIC: For resize calculate the output pixel value using cubic interpolation on all 
             pixels that may contribute to the output value. For other transformations cubic 
             interpolation over a 4x4 environment in the input image is used.
    LANCZOS: Calculate the output pixel value using a high-quality Lanczos filter (a truncated sinc) 
             on all pixels that may contribute to the output value.
